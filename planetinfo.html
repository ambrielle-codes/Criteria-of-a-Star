                    <p id="earth1">Energy is needed for all living things to grow, move, and survive.The sun provides light and heat, keeping a planet warm enough for life.Plants use sunlight to make food, which supports animals and other organisms.Energy helps living things stay active and repair their bodies.It powers weather and ocean currents that spread heat and nutrients.Energy is needed to keep water moving, like rain, rivers, and clouds. Without energy, life could not exist or stay alive.</p>

                    <p id="earth2">The atmosphere regulates the planet’s temperature through the greenhouse effect, trapping heat from the Sun and maintaining a warm, stable environment. Without this effect, Earth would be too cold to support liquid water and life. The atmosphere also plays a central role in the water cycle by facilitating the evaporation of water, which then condenses into clouds and returns as precipitation. This keeps water supplies replenished and supports the ecosystems that depend on fresh water.</p>

                    <p id="earth3">Furthermore, a good environment includes geological processes, like plate tectonics and volcanic activity, which recycle materials such as carbon and minerals. These processes help regulate the climate and contribute to the formation of fertile soils, which are essential for plant growth. Earth's ability to maintain a stable climate and recycle resources over millions of years has allowed ecosystems to flourish and complex life to evolve.</p>

                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <p>This video explores the vital role of the sun in shaping life on Earth. It explains how day and night are caused by the Earth's rotation and orbit, with one side of the planet always facing the sun while the other is in darkness. The changing seasons depend on the Earth's tilt and its position relative to the sun, creating different climates around the world. The sun also influences the equator's constant summer, while the poles remain frozen. The concept of a year is introduced as Earth's complete revolution around the sun, linking all life to this central star.</p>
