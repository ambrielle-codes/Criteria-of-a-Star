                    <p id="first">A star needs to be the right distance from a planet to maintain conditions suitable 
                    for life, primarily by keeping the planet within the habitable zone, or "Goldilocks zone".
                    This zone is the range where a planet can sustain liquid water, which is essential for 
                    life as we know it. If a planet is too close to its star, it becomes too hot, causing 
                    water to evaporate and making the environment inhospitable. However, if the planet is 
                    too far away, it becomes too cold, freezing any liquid water and hindering life. 
                    The right distance allows for a stable, moderate temperature that can support liquid water
                    on the planet's surface. The size and brightness of the star also influence the habitable 
                    zone, with larger, hotter stars having zones farther out, and cooler stars having them 
                    closer in. In addition, a planetâ€™s atmosphere plays a role by trapping heat, helping to 
                    maintain the necessary temperature range for life.</p>

                    <p id="second">A star provides the essential energy that drives the processes needed for life on a habitable planet.
                        Through nuclear fusion, stars generate light and heat, creating stable conditions on the planet's 
                        surface. Without this energy, a planet would be too cold for liquid water, which is crucial for life
                        as we know it. The star's radiation also influences the planet's atmosphere, maintaining the balance 
                        of gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide, which are necessary for life. A star's gravitational pull 
                        helps keep a planet in a stable orbit, ensuring that conditions remain conducive to habitability over 
                        long periods. In addition, elements produced by stars, such as carbon and oxygen, are the building 
                        blocks of life, enriching the planets chemistry. In the long run, the star's energy and material 
                        contributions sustain ecosystems, promote biodiversity, and make a planet suitable for life.

                <p><b>Summary</b></p>
                <p>Stars start their life in a nebula, a cloud of gas and dust. Gravity pulls the gas and dust together to form a protostar, which then becomes a main sequence star as nuclear fusion begins. When the star runs out of fuel , it expands into a red giant or supergiant. Finally, the star's core collapses, resulting in a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.</p>
